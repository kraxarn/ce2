# CrowEngine 2 / KraXmas 2
This is the source code for the 2017 version of the custom CrowEnigne game engine, used in the 
[KraXmas 2](https://kraxarn.itch.io/kraxmas2) game. Keep in mind that this is currently old code, and probably doesn't 
compile anymore. Hopefully this can be the base for the new re-release of the game with cross-platform support, 
scheduled for release during winter 2022.
