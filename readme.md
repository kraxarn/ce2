# CrowEngine v3
Version 3 of my custom game engine built on top of SDL2, using C++11. Currently, very early in
development and not quite ready for use in production just yet.

Check out the [v2](https://github.com/kraxarn/crowengine/tree/v2) branch for the old version based
on SFML/Allegro, no longer maintained or developed.

## External dependencies
External dependencies required to build/run the engine:
* [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)
* [SDL2_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf)
